I've been making more time lately for reading, it's been great! Here's what I've read and am in the middle of reading:

# Read, Game Engine Black Book: DOOM by Fabien Sanglard

Sanglard breaks down the history and architecture of Doom and it's innovative engine design. 

Doom's design was a complement of its chosen development platform: The NeXT workstation. NeXT promised big boosts to acceleration user interface design and introduced objective oriented paradigms as the standard for all programs on the platform with the introduction of Objective C. This lead to Doom having great developmental tooling and a smart, modular design that later paid dividends when porting to other systems.

What I loved most learning about Doom's development was what it's like innovating in a space pre-internet. Id software in that era would buy cases of old academic papers to use as references and on a few occasions would invite the authors of some of the papers to come and talk about implementation details for Doom.

# Reading, Design After Capitalism

Design after Capitalism is one part a history of how we got here, *gestures broadly,* and one part what we can do about it. By breaking down the contradictions and impacts of the current system, we can better understand how to build more equitable solutions. 

This has been a very dense but productive read so far. I'm about a quarter of the way through and which is still mostly discussing the impacts of capitalism, but excited for the principle of design to be discussed.

# Reading, Homeless is a Housing Problem

Another book I'm in the middle of is Housing is a Homeless problem by Gregg Colburn and co. Colburn and their fellow researchers within the Puget Sound area postulate while homelessness has very regional reasons for their prevalence, there is a statistically significant trend that broad increases in affordable housing can enable us to drastically reduce or eliminate homelessness.

I think this book takes a really great approach to tackling such a diverse and politically charged problem. I am also only a quarter into this book but looking forward to it's future discussions and plans.
